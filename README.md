# ArchetypeTest
This template can be used to start your own Jexxa application
 
##  Requirements

*   Java 17+ installed
*   IDE with maven support 
*   [Optional] Docker or Kubernetes if you want to run your application in a container. See [here](README-GitHub.md) for more information.   
*   [Optional] A locally running [developer stack](deploy/developerStack.yml) providing a Postgres database, ActiveMQ broker, and Swagger-UI 

## Build the Project

*   Checkout the new project in your favorite IDE

*   Without running [developer stack](deploy/developerStack.yml):
    ```shell
    mvn clean install -P '!integrationTests'

    java -jar "-Dio.jexxa.config.import=src/test/resources/jexxa-local.properties" target/archetypetest-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    ```

*   [Optional] **With** running [developer stack](deploy/developerStack.yml):
    ```shell
    mvn clean install
    
    java -jar "-Dio.jexxa.config.import=src/test/resources/jexxa-test.properties" target/archetypetest-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    ```

*   Now you can use `curl` to access your application, or open this [http://localhost:7503/BookStoreService/getBooks](http://localhost:7503/BookStoreService/getBooks) in your browser:
    ```Console
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:7503/BookStoreService/getBooks
    ```
    Response should look as follows 
    ```Console
    [
      {"isbn13":"978-1-60309-322-4"},{"isbn13":"978-1-891830-85-3"},
      {"isbn13":"978-1-60309-047-6"},{"isbn13":"978-1-60309-025-4"},
      {"isbn13":"978-1-60309-016-2"},{"isbn13":"978-1-60309-265-4"}
    ]
    ```
*   [Optional] See [here](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaTutorials/blob/main/BookStore/README-OPENAPI.md#explore-openapi) how to use the application with Swagger-UI

## Start Developing your Project

### Set up your project on GitHub  

In order to continuously build and deploy your application, we recommend using GitHub as described [here](README-GitHub.md).

### Cleanup Readme

After successfully set up your new project, you should clean up the text of README as described [here](https://www.makeareadme.com)
